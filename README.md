# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

This project is a simple inventory app. It allows the user to load all of their items, add new ones, and delete existing ones.

## Sources and Credits

I did not use a ton of resources for this but I did reference these to help me figure out some of the syntaxing for this project.
